# Agent guide — {{name}} (Pattern · studio modpack)

You are working in a **Pattern** project: a workflow engine where logic lives in
**workflows** (JSON graphs of typed ops) and code lives in **ops** (plain
functions contributed by mods). This project also runs `@pattern/mod-admin` — a
visual control plane at `/admin` that edits, versions, runs, and observes those
workflows. Your job is usually one of: add an op, add a route/workflow, or
extend the admin. Recipes for each are below.

## Ground rules

1. **Never guess op names or ports.** Ground truth is one command away:
   - `npx pattern ops` — every available op (core + this project's mods)
   - `npx pattern ops core.string` — filter by prefix
   - `npx pattern ops core.string.template` — full ports + config detail
2. **Validate every workflow JSON you touch:** `npx pattern validate <file>`,
   and `npx pattern graph <file>` to see the graph in the terminal.
3. `npm run dev` hot-reloads on file changes (workflows and mods included).
4. Don't edit `./.pattern` by hand — it's the admin's versioned workflow store
   (treat it like a database; commit it, don't rewrite it).

## Mental model (60 seconds)

- An **op** is a reusable definition: type id, typed input/output **ports**, a
  config schema, an `execute`. A **node** is an op instance in a workflow with
  its own `config`. **Edges** connect output ports to input ports.
- Ports have a kind — `value`, `stream`, or `control` — and only same-kind
  ports connect. Edge kind is derived, never declared:
  - value→value is a **barrier** (consumer awaits the value),
  - stream→stream is **concurrent** with backpressure,
  - control→control is a dataless sequencing pulse.
  To cross value↔stream insert an adapter: `core.stream.accumulate`
  (stream→value) or `core.stream.emit` (value→stream).
- Every op implicitly has control ports `in` and `out` (wiring optional; a node
  with wired control-ins waits for **all** of them). Control-flow ops
  (`core.flow.branch`, `core.flow.switch`) pulse **named** control-outs
  selectively; the untaken side is skipped and the skip propagates.
- **Boundaries** connect a graph to the world, usually a **trigger** (no graph
  inputs; its outputs are the external input) paired with an **out-gate** (its
  resolved inputs are the external result). One run = one trigger firing; only
  that trigger's reachable subgraph executes.

## Workflow JSON anatomy

```jsonc
{
  "$schema": "pattern/workflow/v1",
  "id": "my-flow",                       // slug; unique
  "name": "Human title",
  "description": "Shows in the admin catalog.",
  "nodes": [
    {
      "id": "in",                        // unique within the workflow
      "op": "boundary.http.request",     // an op type — verify with `npx pattern ops`
      "title": "Short label",            // optional, shown on the canvas
      "comment": "Markdown note shown in the editor.",
      "config": { "method": "GET", "path": "/things/:id" },
      "ui": { "x": 40, "y": 120 }        // canvas position; keep ~300px x-steps
    }
  ],
  "edges": [
    { "from": { "node": "in", "port": "params" }, "to": { "node": "next", "port": "data" } }
  ]
}
```

Config values support **env interpolation**, resolved at registration:
`"port": { "$env": "API_PORT", "type": "number", "default": 3001 }` or string
forms `"${API_KEY}"` / `"${REGION:-eu}"`.

## Recipe: add an HTTP route

Routes are declared **inside the workflow** — there is no route table. The
`boundary.http.request` trigger's config carries method, `path`
(`:segment` params), optional `port`, `cors`, and JSON-Schema validation for
`body` / `query` / `params` (enforced by the engine; bad input → 400).
Outputs: `method, url, path, headers, query, params, body`. Pair it with
`boundary.http.response` (inputs: `body`, `status`, `headers`).

Two ways to ship it:

- **File-based**: drop the JSON in `workflows/` — registered at boot,
  hot-reloaded under `npm run dev`, listed read-only in the admin. Best for
  routes that belong in git.
- **Admin-authored**: build it in the editor at `/admin` (or POST through the
  admin API) — versioned in `./.pattern`, deployable/rollbackable.

Objects written to `body` serialize as JSON automatically. See the seeded
`hello` and `quote` workflows (admin → Workflows) for canonical shapes —
`src/examples.ts` has their JSON.

## Recipe: add an op

Ops live in **mods**. This project has an app-local mod at `mods/quotes.mjs` —
extend it or add a sibling file (then list it in `pattern.config.json` →
`mods`). Minimal contract (plain ESM, no build step):

```js
/** @type {import("@pattern/core").PatternMod} */
export default {
  name: "my-mod",
  ops: [
    {
      type: "app.slugify",                       // namespace your ops "app.*"
      description: "Lowercase + dashes.",        // shows in catalogs — write one
      inputs: { value: { kind: "value", required: true } },
      outputs: { out: { kind: "value" } },
      execute: async (ctx) => ({
        out: String(await ctx.input.value("value")).toLowerCase().replace(/\s+/g, "-"),
      }),
    },
  ],
};
```

`execute` receives `ctx`: `await ctx.input.value("name")` (one await per value
input), `ctx.config` (validated config object), `ctx.signal` (AbortSignal —
respect it in loops/timers). Return `{ portName: value }`. For streams, return
a `ReadableStream` on a `{ kind: "stream" }` port.

TypeScript mods can use the typed helpers from `@pattern/core`
(`pureOp`, `defineOp`, `required`, `value`, `stream`, `z`) — same shape,
Zod-typed ports and config.

**Verify:** `npx pattern ops app.` must list your op. Then wire it in a
workflow and `npx pattern validate` it.

## Recipe: extend the admin

A mod's `frontend` block adds UI to the admin — no admin code changes. See
`mods/quotes.mjs` for a working example (menu + page + command):

- **Menu**: `{ category, label, icon, path, order }` — `icon` is a lucide name.
- **Tier-1 page** (no build step): `{ path, view }` where `view` is one of
  `table` (`{ source, columns, actions? }` — `source` is an op type or workflow
  id), `form` (`{ schema, submit }`), `chart`, `json`, `markdown`
  (`{ source }`), `graph` (`{ workflow }`), `iframe` (`{ url }`).
- **Command** (⌘K palette): `{ id, label, group, run?, path? }`.
- **Tier-2 page** (full React): `{ path, remote: "/ext/my-page.js" }` — an ESM
  file you serve yourself (e.g. a `boundary.http.app` mount). It reads
  `globalThis.__PATTERN_ADMIN__` for the shared `React`, `api` client, and the
  glass `ui` kit, and default-exports a component. Reach for Tier-2 only when a
  declarative view can't express the page.

## Project layout

```
pattern.config.json   # mods to load + workflows dir — the app manifest
mods/quotes.mjs       # app-local mod: ops + admin page (the live example)
workflows/            # file-based workflow JSON (read-only in the admin)
src/index.ts          # loadProject() → start(); prints the admin URL
src/examples.ts       # first-boot seed (only into an empty ./.pattern store)
.pattern/             # admin workflow store: versions + audit — committed
```

## Verification loop

1. `npx pattern validate workflows/<file>.json` after every JSON edit.
2. `npm run dev`, then `curl localhost:3000/<route>` for routes.
3. Admin sanity: `/admin` → Workflows (is it live?), Runs (did it trace?),
   Ops (is your op registered, with description?).
4. One-off run without HTTP: `engine.run("<id>", { input: {...} })` from
   `src/index.ts` or a scratch script.
